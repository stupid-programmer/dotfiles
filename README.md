### Attempted to keep it as minimal as possible

#### Lots of help taken from the following sources:
- [Jess Archers Laracasts series on nvim](https://laracasts.com/series/neovim-as-a-php-ide)
- [Typecraft's nvim setup vidoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHTeCSVAFNY&list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn)
